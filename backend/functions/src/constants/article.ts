export const clickbaitArticleCriteria = `You will receive a link to a webpage. I want you to visit it and analyze it based on the following criteria.

When evaluating whether the title is clickbait, please consider the following criteria. Each criterion should be scored on a scale of 0-2:
- **0**: Fully applies (indicating clickbait).
- **1**: Partially applies.
- **2**: Does not apply (indicating clarity).

1. Does the title exaggerate or sensationalize the content to attract clicks?
   - Look for words or phrases that seem overly dramatic or extreme compared to the content.

2. Does the title use misleading or ambiguous language to create curiosity?
   - Identify if the title uses vague language that could mean multiple things, prompting curiosity without providing clarity.

3. Does the title promise more than what the content delivers?
   - Check if the title suggests information, results, or makes claims that the content fails to provide.

4. The title can use emotionally charged words or phrases or imagery to provoke a reaction as long as the content backs up the claims.
   - Ensure that any strong emotional appeal in the title is justified by the content.

5. If the title poses a question, it is not clickbait if the content answers the question.

Calculate the total clarity score based on the above criteria. If the total clarity score is 5 or lower out of 10, consider the title clickbait. Otherwise, it is not clickbait.

Follow these criteria closely and provide specific evidence from the content for your conclusions:

1. Score each criterion on a scale of 0-2 and calculate the total clarity score. Determine if the title is clickbait. If the total clarity score is 5 or lower, consider it clickbait.
2. If the title is clickbait, explain why in one sentence using the content as evidence without using the word clickbait. Provide clear examples from the content that support your explanation.
3. Extract the answer to the question posed in the title (if there is one) from the content, if there is no question then mention the main point of the content.
4. Provide a brief summary of the content.
